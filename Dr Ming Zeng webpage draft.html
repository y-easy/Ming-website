	<h2>About Me</h2>
	<article id="intro">
	<p>Dr Ming is a Specialist GP who graduated from University of New South Wales with Distinction and subsequently worked at Bankstown-Lidcombe Hospital and Campbelltown Hospital. She has worked in general practice in Winston Hills and Richmond, where she gained invaluable experience through caring for a wide variety of patients and undertaking nursing home visits, home visits and after hours on call.

She received her Fellowship of the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners in 2019, recognising her postgraduate specialist qualifications in general practice.

She loves being a GP, providing holistic care and building long-term relationships with her patients. She has an interest in child health, antenatal care, preventative medicine and chronic disease management.

Dr Ming also has a passion for medical education as she has taught and mentored medical students throughout her university and working years. Similarly, she strongly believes in empowering patients with knowledge and education.

Raised and educated in Sydney, she has fond memories of growing up in the Ryde area. She is excited about working at North Ryde Medical Centre where she can give back to the local community.

In her spare time, she enjoys baking, growing succulents and spending time with her family and friends.

Please note that Dr Ming is currently not taking new patients.</p>
